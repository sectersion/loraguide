# loraguide

Hello! In this guide, you will create a custom Meshtastic-enabled LORA board with a microcontroller, antenna, radio chip, and other things.

## First things first

To start your project, we need to download KiCad. KiCad is an open-source software for designing circuit boards, or PCBs. We can use the terms interchangably.

Go to https://www.kicad.org/download/ and install the version for your OS. After that finishes, create a new project. Name it anything you want, but I will name mine Loraguide.

After that finishes, you should be on a screen that looks like this:

# The Schematic

The first step to designing a circuit board is the schematic. A schematic is essentially a wiring diagram, to show which components connect to what. That means it is very important that we follow a few design rules when creating our schematic:

 - Power symbols always point up
 - Ground symbols always point down
 - Net labels can be used instead of wires

First, click **Schematic Editor** on the main project page. Hit the **A** key to open the symbol chooser. Search "esp32-s3" and select the **ESP32-S3-WROOM-1**.

<img width="858" height="664" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7c6b7388-1b3c-4758-83cc-29ade888a8ab" />

Place it in the middle. Next, search for the **SX1262** radio chip and place it to the left of the ESP32.

## Power system

### Organization
To keep things clean, use **Power Symbols** instead of drawing wires everywhere. Hit **P**, type +3V3, and place it on the 3V3 pin of the ESP32. Do the same for GND.

### Power input
Search for "USB_C_Receptacle_USB2.0_14P". 

Connect the GND pins to a GND power symbol. **Note on the SHIELD pins:** Do not connect these directly to GND. This can feed RF noise back into your host computer. For this project, leave the shield pins isolated or connected to a separate chassis pad if available.

Connect **VBUS** to a **+5V** power symbol. Place two **5.1k ohm** resistors (R_Small) on the **CC1** and **CC2** pins and connect the other ends to GND. This ensures your USB-C charger provides the correct 5V.

## SX1262 Power & RF

### Power Decoupling
Chips draw sudden bursts of current. Decoupling capacitors (100nF and 10µF) act as local water tanks, sitting right next to the chip to handle these bursts.

Connect **VDD_IN** to **+3V3** and place one **100nF** and one **10µF** capacitor between that line and GND.

### The DCC_SW Inductor
The SX1262 has an internal DC-DC converter that requires a **15µH inductor** on the **DCC_SW** pin. This inductor needs special care; it is a switching component right next to the radio. On the PCB, it must be placed as close as possible to the pin.



### RF Output Matching
Simply running a wire to the antenna is inefficient and can be illegal because it emits harmonics. You need a **matching network** (filtering) on the RF output. This usually involves a series inductor and capacitors to GND between the **RFO** pin and the antenna connector.



| Pin | What to do: |
|---|---|
| VDD_IN | Decouple with 100nF and 10µF |
| VBAT | Draw a direct wire to VDD_IN |
| VBAT_IO | Decouple with one 100nF capacitor |
| VREG | Decouple with one 100nF capacitor |
| DCC_SW | Connect 15µH inductor |
| VR_PA | 100nF capacitor to GND (DO NOT connect to 3.3V) |
| GND | Connect directly to GND |

### 5V to 3.3V conversion
Use an **AMS1117-3.3** LDO regulator to convert the 5V from USB to the 3.3V our chips need.

| Pin | Connection |
|-----|-----------|
| VIN | +5V from VBUS + 10µF cap to GND |
| VOUT | +3V3 + 10µF cap to GND |
| GND | GND |

## USB Data, Buttons, and SPI

### USB Data Lines
Connect the **D+** and **D-** pins of the USB connector to the **USB Data + and -** pins on the ESP32. Use **Net Labels (L)** to keep the wires from crossing.

### Boot and Reset Buttons
Both the **EN** (Reset) and **GPIO0** (Boot) pins need a **10kΩ pull-up resistor** to 3.3V. Connect push buttons that pull these pins to GND when pressed.

### SPI & Control Wiring
| Signal | ESP32 Pin | SX1262 Pin |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| SCK    | GPIO5     | SCK        |
| MOSI   | GPIO6     | MOSI       |
| MISO   | GPIO7     | MISO       |
| NSS    | GPIO8     | NSS        |
| RESET  | GPIO3     | RESET      |
| BUSY   | GPIO4     | BUSY       |
| DIO1   | GPIO9     | DIO1       |

# PCB Section

## Footprint Assignment
In **Tools > Assign Footprints**, assign the physical shapes. For resistors and capacitors, **R_0402** or **C_0402** are standard for these boards.

## Placement
1. **ESP32:** Place at the top. Ensure the antenna "keep-out" area is outside the board edge.
2. **SX1262 & U.FL Connector:** Place these very close together.
3. **DCC_SW Inductor:** Place this right against the radio chip pin.
4. **Decoupling Caps:** Place them right next to their respective power pins.

## Routing Order
Sensitive signals must be routed first so they have the cleanest, most direct paths.

1. **RF Trace First:** Shortest path from chip to antenna. Use 45-degree angles.
2. **USB Data Lines:** Route D+ and D- as a pair, keeping them similar in length.
3. **SPI & Control Signals:** Connect the communication lines.
4. **Power Traces:** 3.3V and 5V. Use wider traces (0.5mm) for these.
5. **GND:** Handled by the copper pour.

## Ground Plane and Stitching
Add a **Filled Zone (Z)** for GND on both the top (**F.Cu**) and bottom (**B.Cu**) layers. 

To prevent "floating" ground islands and interference, add **stitching vias**. These are small holes that connect the top and bottom ground planes. Place them around the perimeter of the board and near the RF trace.



## Final Steps
Run the **DRC (Design Rule Check)** to find errors. Export your **Gerbers** and **Drill Files**, zip them up, and upload to a manufacturer like JLCPCB.

You have designed a grounded and RF-safe LoRa board.
